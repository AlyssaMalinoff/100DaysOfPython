This is a small game that compares the follower count (on Instagram) of two celebrities, and if you guess correctly you get a point. You want to get as many points as possible, and if you guess wrong its game over.

Disclaimer that the follower count is hardcoded so some of these may be outdated, but its still a fun game! Down the road it would be interesting to have a game where if looks for current follower counts in a more dynamic way. 

This is the project for Day 14 of the 100 days of code bootcamp by Angela Yu.
